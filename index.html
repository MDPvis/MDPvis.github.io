                    Connect to our simplified wildfire suppression simulator and optimizer. In this domain,
                    rewards are given by tree harvest volumes and costs are incurred by spending money
                    on wildfire suppression. Letting a wildfire burn may reduce the harvestable timber,
                    but it will also reduce fuels on the landscape and fire suppression expenses. This is
                    a very challenging large state MDP.
